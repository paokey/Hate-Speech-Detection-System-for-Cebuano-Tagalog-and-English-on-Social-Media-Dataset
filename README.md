# Leveraging Machine Learning Models in Developing a Web-Based Multilingual Hate Speech Detection System for Cebuano, Tagalog, and English on Social Media Leveraging Machine Learning Models in Developing a Web-Based Multilingual Hate Speech Detection System for Cebuano, Tagalog, and English on Social Media

Inside this repository is the raw dataset I used for my study. Itâ€™s the original, unprocessed data before cleaning and analysis. This dataset was the base for building and testing my models, and Iâ€™m sharing it here to keep the work transparent, reproducible, and useful for others exploring similar research.
